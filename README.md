# Radlister

Radlister is a full-stack database-driven Ebay/Craiglist clone.

The technology stack is Linux, nginx, MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Object Oriented PHP is used without a framework.
We use the PDO library to communicate with MySQL.


# Getting Started
- `git pull origin master` to pull down the latest code.
- Make yourself a `.env.php` file in the root of your `radlister.dev` project directory.
